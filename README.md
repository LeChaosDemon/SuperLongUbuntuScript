UBUNTU SCRIPT 
WORKS BUT WON'T DO PAM.D FILES
Gave up toubleshooting that and just made another dif script for that 

Before; To make things easier and as long as the readme permits updates run: “sudo apt update”  Then: “sudo apt full-upgrade” type “y” once prompted and hit enter. This will take time.. “sudo reboot” after its all done.  
This will update everything with ease
This only will work properly if you configure the GUI update settings first. 
I don’t recommend doing other things while these updates are running but you could.

All passwords get changed to: “Cyb3rC0nt3stL0Lol”
After all of this make sure you do “sudo reboot” 
Auto logins will be disabled.. I don’t think I will change that so be sure to remember that the password has been changed There is no need to panic lol
Another note: If prompted in package config: Select the first option: “install the package maintainer's version” (To do this use the up and down arrows to highlight it the press enter) it will not change the current installed Ubuntu release. Instead, it will make everything compatible with the currently installed Ubuntu. The first option is the safest option to choose when presented with the Package distributor has shipped an updated version menu because it is the option that allows you to update your system normally and returns your system to a condition where there is nothing that interferes with default package management.

Changes all user passwords to: Cyb3rC0nt3stL0Lol    {   This includes the sudo user (yourself) so “set a custom password” and use the already provided password.. Ex: M4mm@lOfAct!0n   to prevent the pass being changed to Cyb3rC0nt3stL0Lol    }

Only run script after ALL f-questions are done
delete any users, add any to groups etc.
